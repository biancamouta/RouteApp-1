# README

This is an ongoing project. It's a Ruby on Rails web app that builds graph structures and stores the information in a Postgres database. 

I designed it as a school assignment about minimum paths optimization and kept using it to apply new things I have been stud√Ωing such as css.

Things you may want to cover:

* Build the database and fill it with some sample data:
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

* How to run the test suite
rspec
